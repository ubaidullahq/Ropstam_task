Hi there my name is Ubaidullah and I am a Flutter developer. I've been working as a flutter developer since 2020, it's been 2 years. I've worked on different projects domains like healthcare, Taxi booking, skilled labour hiring apps so on. this was a demo app, here you can see my approach towards programming an problem solving. In this project you'll see proper OOP concepts for optimizing, writing clean code. Due to short time I've done this it could be done better than that.
